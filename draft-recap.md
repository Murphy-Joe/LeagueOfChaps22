We're back for a THIRD installment of League of Chaps!  We salute old **Jim Gray** Hairs for his service these last two seasons, and welcome the "Todd Father", team name should be "the Toddlers" (credit Melinda), **Todd Nyerges**. 

Quick number crunching summary of the last 2 seasons.  While **TJ** and **I** have brought home trophies there have been FOUR teams to make the playoffs BOTH years.  They are like the Alabama, Ohio State, Clemson, and Georgia of this league. Shout out to **Nate**, **Tony**, **Melinda**, and **Kevin**. 

In recapping this year's draft, I'll once again provide incorrect opinions on each of your teams.  The formula will be:

``Forefathers``: IE your first 4 draft picks and what will likely be the foundation of your team

``One-liner``: One of your fantasy football related quotes or events

``Reasons for hope``

``Reasons for worry``

``Sneaky good player`` 

<br>

In reverse draft order...

<br>

# 12. Kevin - A Swift Kick in the Pants {'21 4th Place}
``Forefathers`` 
> **Ja'Marr Chase, D'Andre Swift, Breece Hall, Travis Etienne Jr.**

`One Liner`
> Successfully or unsuccessfully explained to Carrie he could draft from his phone while out to dinner because the 12 spot is only on the clock 8 times intead of 17.  

`Reasons for Hope`
> A lot of players with a supposedly better outlook this year (Aiyuk coming off a strong end of the year, **Marquise Brown** on an offense that passes more, **Etienne** back and Urban Meyer gone)

`Reasons for Worry`
>  Almost a repeat of the reasons for hope. New situations for over half the team.  **Tom Brady** sans Bruce Arians / Antonio Brown / Gronk / pre-ACL Godwin / some O-Line starters. **Aiyuk**'s new QB is a runner. **Marquise Brown** is a WR transitioning to a new team which doesn't always work out (see Kenny Golladay). **Etienne / Drake London / Breece Hall** have never played in the NFL

`Sneaky Good Player`
>    ****D'Andre Swift**** doesn't qualify as too sneaky as he was drafted in the first round, but I think he belongs with the top 5 backs based on Detroit's offensive line, his early down / third down / goal line usage, Jared Goff's ascension to average, and the expectation for Detroit to be (gasp) ..good? 

<br>

# 11. Todd - The ToddFather

`Forefathers`
> **Stefan Diggs, Nick Chubb, Cam Akers, Terry McLaurin**

`One Liner`
> "I came here to take a grown man's job!" Actually said by 7th round rookie [Isaiah Pacecho](https://twitter.com/jbbrisco/status/1520546849702264832) but woulda been cool if that was Todd's intro to the league chat. 

`Reasons for Hope`
> Has a lot of depth all the way down the lineup which will be enviable once bye weeks hit in week 6 and go all the way to week 14!

`Reasons for Worry`
> Good players in secondary roles may have some dry weeks along the way as usage may be inconsistent (**Jerry Jeudy, Cam Akers, DeVonta Smith, Melvin Gordon**)

`Sneaky Good Player`
> **Nick Chubb**.  Another not sneaky player but look at that early schedule: wk 1 Carolina, wk 2 Jets, wk 4 Atlanta. If Chubb gets Todd a winning record early that affords him the ability to wait on long term good players instead of needing immediate contributors.  Can be key for trades and waiver moves. 

<br>

# 10. Daniel - Chubble in Paradise
`Forefathers`
> **Joe Mixon, Aaron Jones, Big Mike Williams, Courtland Sutton**

`One Liner`
> Discussed mock drafts with Nate for 20+ hours in preparation for this year's draft. Took all Nate's players one slot ahead of him in the even rounds. 

`Reasons for Hope`
> If you believe the pre-season buzz, **Mike Thomas** is back in 2019 form, **Dameon Pierce** is this year's breakout rookie RB, **Courtland Sutton** is Russ's new #1, and the Chargers finally found a do-it-all backup for Ekeler in **Isaiah Spiller**

`Reasons for Worry`
> Fringe players at the onesie positions QB and TE, waiting all the way until the 18th QB taken to select **Matt Ryan**, and the 12th TE to take **Albert O**. the 6 RB/WRs might all hit and make up for it though. 

`Sneaky Good Player`
>  **Albert Okwuegbunam**, whom I just called a fringe player, is nonetheless intriguing. He's a Njoku speed/size freak with a high-end QB, and no longer has to cede catches to Tim Patrick or Noah Fant.

<br>


# 9. Nate - Oglebay Fighting Elk {'21 2nd place}
`Forefathers`
> **Najee Harris, Saquon Barkley, Keenan Allen, Eli Mitchell**

`One Liner`
> Discussed mock drafts with Daniel for 20+ hours in preparation for this year's draft. Took all Daniels's players one slot ahead of him in the odd rounds. 

`Reasons for hope`
> 4 three-down backs (**Najee, Saquon, Eli Mitchell, Josh**) and 3 WRs in high power offenses (**Keenan Allen** - LAC, **Gabriel Davis** - BUF, **Adam Thielen** - MIN) 

`Reasons for worry`
> Like Daniel, did not pick the onesie QB/TE positions until late, waiting until QB 13 (**Stafford**) and TE 16 (**Higbee**). **Keenan Allen** and **Adam Thielen** are looking at decline sometime in the near future, if that future is not now, but both have great situations. 
*Update: Nate has already upgraded his QB situation by trading Melinda for the 10th QB taken, **Russell Wilson**. 
**
`Sneaky Good Player`
> **Jameis Winston** was actually pretty good before injury last year, and that was with Marquez Callaway as his #1 WR.  He now has Michael Thomas, Jarvis Landry, and Chris Olave. 

<br>


# 8. Joe - Cleveland Commodores
`Forefathers`
> **Dalvin Cook, Ceedee Lamb, DJ Moore, Allen Robinson**

`One Liner`
> Wins championship. "...Oh ya we should have a rile that if you win the championship you get first choice of draft slot"

`Reasons for hope`
> Hoping KC can settle on one running back, and that it's one of the ones I have. 

`Reasons for worry`
> Zero depth as all bench spots are occupied by people who will score zero points unless someone in front of them gets injured

`Sneaky Good Player`
>  **Josh Palmer**, with rose colored glasses on, can be for the Chargers what Antonio Brown was for the Bucs.  And ready to step into primetime if there were to be an injury to Keenan or BMW. 

<br>


# 7. Tony - TMagic  {'21 5th Place}
`Forefathers`
> **Derrick Henry, Lenny Fournette, AJ Brown, Diontae Johnson**

`One Liner`
> after Jim retired from fantasy football: "Crap! I'm the only old guy." 

`Reasons for Hope`
> If **Derrick Henry** is still Derrick Henry, not too much else matters. 

`Reasons for Worry`
> The QB situation of the 3 starting WR's: **AJ Brown** - Jalen Hurts,  **Diontae Johnson** - Kenny Pickett, **Darnell Mooney** - Justin Fields.  Great WR's can usually overcome a below average QB, but just good WR's have a little more trouble. 

`Sneaky Good Player`
> **Darren Waller** plays like he's Kelce but got drafted like he's Kittle.  He now has the OC (Josh McDaniels) that created monsters out of Rob Gronkowski and Aaron Hernandez.   

<br>


# 5. TJ - Passless Chaps {Consolation Winner}
`Forefathers`
> **Austin Ekeler, Davante Adams, Tee Higgins, Josh Allen**

`One Liner`
> "Technically, I'm a two time Chapeks League champ."

`Reasons for hope`
> Doesn't need hope, this is the strongest lineup top to bottom. His primary guys (the 4 above) could all single handedly win him a week.  His secondary guys (**Amon St Brown, Miles Sanders, George Kittle**) are all blends of talent + good situations

`Reasons for worry`
> Only 2 RB's on the squad. Depending on which **Miles Sanders** shows up this year, this could be the achilles heel. 

`Sneaky Good Player`
> **Miles Sanders** has everything set up for him.  He's on the NFC's version of the Ravens, but with one of the best offensive lines in the league. And his main carry competition in Jordan Howard is gone.  Just has to show up. 

<br>

# 5. Melinda - Peppa Pigskins {'21 6th place}
`Forefathers`
> **Cooper Kupp, Alvin Kamara, Ezekiel Elliot, Kyle Pitts**

`One Liner`
> "Nate!?" ..Right after Andrew sighed relief that autodraft didn't give him Ezekiel Elliot this year ..Which was 1 minute after Nate recommended that she take **Ezekiel Elliot**. 

`Reasons for hope`
> Rounds 6-8 is where Melinda probably sealed the deal to her 3rd straight playoff appearance, landing **Ju-Ju, Kyler, and Godwin** in the middle rounds. 

`Reasons for worry`
> There is some skepticism the the RBs  will be as productive this year as they have in years past (**Zeke** - declining, **Kamara** - w/o Sean Payton, **Damien Harris** - more rotational)

`Sneaky Good Player`**
> **Ju-Ju Smith Schuster** seems to fit the profile of "player most likely to pull a Cooper Kupp" in that he's a good player still in his prime, was held back by poor QB play, and is now likely the #1 WR of the league's best QB. 

<br>

# 4. Garen - Scottish Hammers
`Forefathers`
> **Justin Jefferson, Mike Evans, Michael Pittman Jr, David Montgomery**

`One Liner`
> Goes home, watches the tape, reviews his team's players, scouts the opponents, pours over the analytics, but for the 5 minutes that he's not coaching Lacrosse he sets his fantasy football lineup. 

`Reasons for Hope`
> QB and WRs can carry this team (**Hurts, Justin Jefferson, Mike Evans, Michael Pittman Jr**)

`Reasons for Worry`
> They'll probably have to! The RB room consists of whichever RB Chicago uses (**Montgomery** or **Herbert**) and Green Bay's 2nd option (**AJ Dillon**).  While the TE and Flex (**Dallas Goedert** and **Christian Kirk**) don't look like meaningful contributors just yet. 

`Sneaky Good Player`
> **KJ Osborn** is the ideal 3rd WR.  A cheap draft option who gets enough snaps in a good offense to be startable as is, but who's value would sky rocket if there were to be an injury to Justin Jefferson or Adam Thielen. 

<br>

# 3. Matt - Keep My Team Name Out Yo Mouth {wish I thought of this team name}
`Forefathers`
> **Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce, James Conner, Brandin Cooks**

`One-Liner`
> Can watch the full slate of 1pm games yet still make it to the 9:30am Sunday service 

`Reasons for hope`
> Copying last year's strategy, own the Chiefs! (**Mahomes** and **Kelce**) 

`Reasons for worry`
> 3 Seattle guys in the starting lineup (**DK Metcalf, Tyler Locket, Rashaad Penny**)

`Sneaky Good Player`
> **James Conner**, he didn't fall far in this draft, but he's a 3-down, pass catching, goal line back on a fast paced offense. Penalized for not doing anything exciting while he puts up 1st round RB numbers.

<br>


# 2. Andrew - Berger's Team
`Forefathers`
> **Jonathan Taylor, Tyreek Hill, Javonte Williams, JK Dobbins**

`One Liner`
> After going through great lengths to be prepared for this year's draft, ended up winning the award for *auto-drafting* yahoo's best team

`Reasons for Hope`
> The award winning auto-draft did indeed seem to find player value right at the positions Andrew needed all the way down the lineup. Normally I don't list every starter but take a look  
QB - **Justin Herbert**  
WR - **Tyreek Hill**  
WR - **Rashod Bateman**  
WR - **Elijah Moore**  
RB - **Jonathan Taylor**  
RB - **Javonte Williams**  
TE - **Zach Ertz**  
Flex - **JK Dobbins**  
These guys all seems to have safe high floors as well as untapped high ceilings. 

`Reasons for Worry`
> The pass catchers after Tyreek (**Bateman, Moore, Ertz**) all have to improve this year to be worth starting, but they're expected to. 

`Sneaky Good Player`
> **JK Dobbins** hype has been very lukewarm for what an ideal situation he's in.  He's very much likely to get all the work his recovering ACL can handle on an offense designed to run the ball. 

<br>

# 1. Joey - JimGrayHairs
`Forefathers`
> **Christian McCaffrey, Mark Andrews, Deebo Samuel, Lamar Jackson**

`One Liner`
> "Andrew's a coward!" (jokingly) After finding out the first pick was still available at his turn. 

`Reasons for Hope`
>  A lot of young guys looking to break out (**Jaylen Waddle, Jahan Dotson, Kadarius Toney, Tony Pollard, George Pickens**)... If 2 out of 5 do this team is stacked.

`Reasons for Worry`
> All of those breakouts except for **Pollard** depend on lower end QBs getting them the ball.  

`Sneaky Good Player`
> Nearly this whole team qualifies as sneaky good as I kept crossing people off my want list every time Joey made his picks.  But **Tony Pollard** (who's been sneaky so long he's no longer sneaky) is the highlight. Pollard seems set to make his way into must-start territory regardless of Zeke's role.  Cowboys have no 2nd WR, and are talking a lot of smoke about Pollard taking snaps there. 

<br>

I wish best of luck, no injuries, and 1st place finishes to all of you.
